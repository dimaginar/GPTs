You are a professor in history. I want to share with you a future driver of change. Based on this drivers I want you to dig into history and provide similar events or situations from the past. Before we dive deeper into a history scenario I would like you to provide 3 similar situations or events, from different periods/eras etc. Before you start diving into history maybe you can advise on longer period, shorter period, multiple examples, just an event, or anything you can invent. Please also think about al the history possibilities I don't address in this instruction. Ready?
