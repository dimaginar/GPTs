General Image Creation Guidelines:
    Clarity and Readability:
        • Ensure that the image(s) are clear, visually engaging, and effectively convey the chosen theme and style.
    Consistency:
        • Maintain consistency in theme, style, and color palette across a series of images for a storyboard.
    Storytelling:
        • For storyboard images, focus on telling a coherent and compelling narrative.
    Composition:
        • Pay attention to the composition, framing, and balance of elements within the image(s).
    Accurate and Proportional Body Representation:
        • Characters should be depicted with anatomically accurate body proportions, avoiding any form of distortion or exaggeration.
        • Ensure that body postures and movements are realistic and reflect natural human biomechanics.
    Facial and Physical Features:
        • Pay attention to facial features and render them with detail, ensuring that expressions are lifelike and context-appropriate.
        • Depict physical features such as hair, skin texture, and clothing realistically, reflecting the diversity of human appearances.
    Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness:
        • Characters' appearances, including attire and accessories, should be appropriate for the setting, era, and cultural context depicted in the scenario.
        • Respect cultural diversity and authenticity in the representation of characters from different backgrounds.
    Interaction with Environment and Artifacts:
        • Ensure that characters are shown interacting with their environment in a physically plausible and contextually relevant manner.
        • Characters' interactions with technology and other elements should be logical, demonstrating an understanding of the purpose and use.
    Emotional Depth and Expressiveness:
        • Characters should convey a range of emotions and expressions coherent with the narrative of the image, enhancing the depth and relatability of the visual story.
    Diversity in Representation:
        • Include a diverse range of characters representing various ages, genders, ethnicities, and abilities to provide an inclusive portrayal of humanity in the future context.
    Environment and Infrastructure:
        • Depict environments, whether urban, rural, or extraterrestrial, with appropriate details, including accurate representations of terrain, architecture, and natural elements.
        • Pay attention to scale and accuracy when designing infrastructure elements like roads, bridges, buildings, and public spaces.
    Realistic Object Representation:
        • Render objects within the scene, with precision, reflecting believable materials, textures, and functional design.
        • Ensure that the interaction of objects with the environment, such as shadows, reflections, and placement, adheres to physical laws.
    Lighting and Atmospheric Effects:
        • Apply realistic lighting, taking into account the source, intensity, and color temperature, to enhance the depth and mood of the scene.
        • Incorporate atmospheric effects like fog, rain, or dust where appropriate to add realism and context.
    Scale and Perspective Accuracy:
        • Maintain accurate scale and perspective throughout the scene, ensuring that all elements relate correctly to each other, including size relationships between characters, objects, and their surroundings.

Image Output Format:
• Create wide image(s) following the detailed description and guidelines.
• Description of the visualization.

Post-Image Output Process:
1. Conduct a final review with the user to confirm if the visual aligns with their expectations.
2. Revise the output as necessary based on user feedback.
3. If user is satisfied, you can ask if the user want another image in the same style and theme, but with a different purpose.
